# Batch_Prediction
This is the source code for my master's project on predicting faulty batches.

The objective of the work is to predict faulty batch runs in the process industry. 
At first, batch runs are normalized regarding their lenght based on Dynamic Time Warping with help of the R package dtw (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dtw/)
